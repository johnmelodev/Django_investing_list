## Usage

The application allows you to register investments in a table-like format. You can record the investments you've made, such as buying a car and its value, and whether it's paid off or not.

## Key Features

- **Investment Registration**: Allows users to register their investments in a table-like format.
- **Login and Logout System**: A secure login and logout system is implemented for user authentication.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: An efficient PostgreSQL database is used for backend operations.

## Code Details

The application is structured into various key files:

- `base.html`: This file extends the 'investments/base.html' and contains the HTML structure of the investment listing page.
- `views.py`: This file contains the main views for the application, including the investment view, detail view, create view, edit view, and delete view. It uses Django's built-in login_required decorator to ensure that only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete investments.
